# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome!

I appreciate your interest in contributing. To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines before creating a pull request (PR) or raising an issue:

## Reading Docs and Existing Issues

Before submitting a question or starting work on a new feature, I encourage you to read the available documentation. You can find the detailed document [here](https://kyoheiu.dev/felix/). It may already answer your question.

Additionally, I recommend checking issues. Someone might have already reported the same issue or requested a similar feature. Reading through the open and closed issues can save both your time and mine and prevent duplication.

## Creating an Issue

If you have gone through the documentation and existing issues but still haven't found a resolution to your question or problem, I kindly ask you to **create a new issue before submitting a pull request**, to discuss a possible way to solve your problem.

## Creating a Pull Request

If you have identified a bug, implemented a new feature, or made improvements to the project, I welcome your pull request. However, I strongly encourage you to follow the steps mentioned above before proceeding with creating a PR.
And note that pull requests should be focused to one issue.

Thank you for reading!
