![sample](https://github.com/kyoheiu/felix/blob/main/screenshots/sample.gif)

While heavliy inspired by the great `vifm` and trying to implement its pleasant experience in Rust, at the same time this project focuses on the following points:

- simple and fast
- easy to configure how to open files

| :                     | Switch to shell mode (***experimantal***). Type command and press Enter to execute it.

| :e                    | Reload the current directory. Useful when something goes wrong in filter mode (e.g. no matches) or shell mode.                                                                                                                                         |
| :empty                | Empty the trash directory. **Please think twice before using this command.**                                                                                                                                                                           |

| :q / ZZ               | Exit the program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Note that items moved to the trash directory are prefixed with Unix time (like `1633843993`) to avoid name conflict. This prefix will be removed when paste.

## Settings

|                 |                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| config file     | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/felix/config.toml` |
| trash directory | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/felix/trash`       |

Default config file, which is [here](config.toml), will be created automatically when you launch the program for the first time.

In config.toml, you can set:

- color of directories, files, and symlinks separatively
- default key for sorting item list ("Name" or "Time")
- how to open files

### Command setting

If you write

```
default = "nvim"

[exec]
feh = ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif", "svg"]
zathura = ["pdf"]
```

then, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif and .svg files are opened by `feh <file-name>`, .pdf files by `zathura <file-name>` and others by `nvim <file-name>` .
